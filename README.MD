# HILO
Hilo is a game in which the player guesses if the next card drawn by the dealer will be higher or lower than the previous one. Points are won or lost based on whether or not the player guessed correctly. The rules are simple. The player starts the game with 300 points. Individual cards are represented as a number from 1 to 13. The player guesses if the next one will be higher or lower. The player earns 100 points if they guessed correctly.
The player loses 75 points if they guessed incorrectly.
If a player reaches 0 points the game is over.
